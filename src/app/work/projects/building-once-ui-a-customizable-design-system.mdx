## Overview

This project focused on embedding **security into the software delivery lifecycle** by building a DevSecOps pipeline. The goal was to prevent vulnerabilities from slipping into production by shifting security left and automating scans as part of CI/CD.  

The pipeline enforces compliance, runs static and dependency scans, and blocks insecure deployments automatically.

---

## Key Features

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Integrated **SonarQube** and **Bandit** to scan codebases for insecure coding patterns and vulnerabilities.
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Added **OWASP Dependency-Check** and **Trivy** to scan dependencies and container images for CVEs.
- **Secrets Scanning**: Prevented hardcoded secrets in repos with tools like **Gitleaks**.
- **Policy Gates**: Configured pipelines to block builds if vulnerabilities above a certain severity were found.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generated compliance and vulnerability reports pushed into Slack/MS Teams for visibility.
- **Cloud Security Checks**: Automated AWS configuration audits with **Terraform validate** and **AWS Config rules**.

---

## Technologies Used

- **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI**: CI/CD pipeline orchestration.
- **SonarQube, Bandit, OWASP Dependency-Check, Trivy**: Security scanning tools.
- **Terraform & AWS Config**: Infrastructure security and compliance checks.
- **Slack/MS Teams Webhooks**: For real-time notifications and reporting.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was balancing **developer velocity** with **security enforcement**. Too many false positives can frustrate teams and slow delivery. To solve this, I:  

- Tuned rules to reduce noise and focused on critical issues first.  
- Built a **security exceptions workflow** for temporary approvals.  
- Added caching and parallelization to keep scan times low (&lt;5 minutes per pipeline).

---

## Outcome

This DevSecOps pipeline created a **“security by default” culture** where vulnerabilities are caught early, reducing risk and saving remediation time.  

- **100% of deployments** now pass automated security checks.  
- Reduced mean time to remediation (MTTR) for vulnerabilities by **60%**.  
- Increased compliance confidence for audits (SOC2, ISO 27001).

This project demonstrates my ability to **embed security into DevOps workflows**, delivering pipelines that are fast, secure, and compliant — essential for modern ML/DevOps and cloud engineering teams.

## Overview

In this project, I built an **end-to-end MLOps pipeline** that takes machine learning models from experimentation to production deployment in a reliable and automated way. The pipeline ensures that data preprocessing, training, validation, deployment, and monitoring are all automated and reproducible.  

The goal was to solve the common problem where ML models work in Jupyter notebooks but fail when deployed to production due to lack of reproducibility, scalability, and monitoring. By integrating DevOps and ML engineering best practices, this project bridges that gap.

## Key Features

- **Data Versioning with DVC**: Tracked datasets and model artifacts to guarantee reproducibility and lineage across different environments.
- **Model Training Pipeline**: Built modular training workflows using **MLflow** for experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and storing results.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline with **GitHub Actions** and **AWS CodePipeline**, ensuring every new model version was validated before deployment.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Packaged models as Docker images and deployed them to **AWS Fargate (ECS)**, ensuring scalable and serverless inference.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Integrated **Prometheus and Grafana** dashboards for model performance and drift detection, with alerts on accuracy drops.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Used **Terraform** to define reproducible infrastructure for S3 buckets, ECS clusters, and IAM roles.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS (S3, ECS/Fargate, CloudWatch, CodePipeline)**: Cloud infrastructure and CI/CD orchestration.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for reproducible environments.
- **Docker**: Containerization for model packaging and deployment.
- **MLflow & DVC**: Model tracking, experiment logging, and artifact versioning.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring metrics and setting up model drift alerts.
- **Python (FastAPI)**: For serving models as REST APIs.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was **integrating ML-specific needs with DevOps practices**. Traditional CI/CD pipelines are not designed for large datasets, non-deterministic training runs, or frequent retraining. Solving this required:  

- Creating caching layers for datasets and models to reduce pipeline runtime.  
- Building validation gates in CI/CD to automatically check accuracy before deployment.  
- Designing monitoring hooks to capture both **infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory)** and **ML metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)**.  

This experience strengthened my ability to align ML workflows with production DevOps standards.

## Outcome

The pipeline reduced model deployment cycles from **weeks to under 2 hours**, while providing **traceability, scalability, and monitoring**.  

Data scientists can now experiment freely, while the DevOps layer ensures every model that reaches production is reproducible, tested, and observable.  

This project highlights my capability to merge **DevOps automation** with **ML engineering**, delivering real-world production-ready AI solutions.

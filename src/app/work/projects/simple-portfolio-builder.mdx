## Overview

In this project, I architected and automated a **multi-AZ disaster recovery solution** on AWS to ensure business continuity during outages. The solution included automated failover, data replication, and infrastructure provisioning using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  

The goal was to minimize downtime and data loss for mission-critical applications, while keeping the setup cost-efficient and fully automated.

## Key Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Used **Terraform** to provision VPCs, subnets, security groups, and replicated resources across multiple Availability Zones.
- **Automated Database Replication**: Configured **Amazon RDS Multi-AZ** deployments with synchronous replication and automated failover.
- **S3 Cross-Region Replication**: Ensured critical data was continuously replicated to a secondary region for compliance and resilience.
- **Load Balancing & Auto Scaling**: Deployed applications behind **Application Load Balancers (ALB)** with **Auto Scaling Groups** for fault tolerance.
- **Disaster Recovery Runbooks**: Automated failover tests using **AWS Systems Manager** and **Lambda**, reducing manual intervention.
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Integrated **CloudWatch + SNS** to detect failures and notify teams instantly.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Terraform**: For reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure.  
- **AWS RDS, S3, ALB, ASG**: Core AWS services for resilience.  
- **AWS Lambda + Systems Manager**: Automating failover testing and runbooks.  
- **CloudWatch + SNS**: Monitoring and alerting.  
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD for infrastructure changes.  

---

## Challenges and Learnings

- Designing for **low RTO/RPO** while keeping costs manageable was a challenge.  
- Solved by automating **cold-standby** environments that scale up only during failover, saving costs while maintaining compliance.  
- Learned the importance of **IaC modularity** to reuse Terraform modules across environments.  

---

## Outcome

- Achieved **99.99% availability** with seamless failover between Availability Zones.  
- Reduced disaster recovery drill time from **4 hours â†’ under 30 minutes**.  
- Provided auditors with evidence of compliance and resilience testing.

This project demonstrates strong expertise in **cloud automation, resilience, and compliance**, showing the ability to build **fault-tolerant architectures** that can withstand failures and protect critical workloads.
